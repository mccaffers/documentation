# Anthropic Claude Integration

QuestDB integrates seamlessly with Anthropic's Claude AI models to enable
intelligent analysis of time-series data. This integration allows you to
leverage Claude's advanced reasoning capabilities to extract insights, generate
reports, and perform complex data analysis on your QuestDB datasets.

## Overview

Anthropic Claude is a family of AI models designed for safety and helpfulness.
When integrated with QuestDB, Claude can:

- Analyze time-series data patterns and trends
- Generate natural language explanations of data insights
- Create automated reports and dashboards
- Provide recommendations based on historical data
- Answer complex queries about your data in plain English

## Prerequisites

Before integrating Claude with QuestDB, ensure you have:

- A QuestDB instance running and accessible
- An Anthropic API key (sign up at
  [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com))
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Network access to both QuestDB and Anthropic APIs

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install anthropic questdb pandas
```

## Basic Integration

### 1. Connect to QuestDB

```python
import anthropic
from questdb.ingress import Sender
import pandas as pd

# Initialize Anthropic client
client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

# Connect to QuestDB
sender = Sender('localhost', 9009)
```

### 2. Query Data and Analyze with Claude

```python
# Query your time-series data
query = """
SELECT timestamp, value, symbol
FROM market_data
WHERE timestamp > dateadd('d', -7, now())
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1000
"""

# Execute query and get results
with sender:
    # Send data to QuestDB if needed
    pass

# Convert results to a format Claude can understand
df = pd.read_sql(query, questdb_connection)

# Prepare data summary for Claude
data_summary = f"""
Time-series data summary:
- Records: {len(df)}
- Date range: {df['timestamp'].min()} to {df['timestamp'].max()}
- Symbols: {df['symbol'].unique()}
- Value range: {df['value'].min()} to {df['value'].max()}
"""

# Ask Claude to analyze the data
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""
            Analyze this time-series data and provide insights:

            {data_summary}

            Please identify:
            1. Key trends and patterns
            2. Anomalies or unusual behavior
            3. Recommendations for further analysis
            4. Potential business insights
            """
        }
    ]
)

print(response.content[0].text)
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### Real-time Data Analysis

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime

async def real_time_analysis():
    while True:
        # Query latest data
        latest_data = query_latest_data()

        # Analyze with Claude
        analysis = await analyze_with_claude(latest_data)

        # Store insights back to QuestDB
        store_insights(analysis)

        await asyncio.sleep(300)  # Analyze every 5 minutes

async def analyze_with_claude(data):
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=500,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Analyze this real-time data and provide immediate insights: {data}"
            }
        ]
    )
    return response.content[0].text
```

### Automated Report Generation

```python
def generate_daily_report():
    # Query daily data
    daily_data = query_daily_data()

    # Generate report with Claude
    report_prompt = f"""
    Generate a comprehensive daily report for this time-series data:
    {daily_data}

    Include:
    - Executive summary
    - Key metrics and KPIs
    - Trend analysis
    - Recommendations
    - Risk alerts
    """

    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=2000,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": report_prompt}]
    )

    return response.content[0].text
```

### Anomaly Detection

```python
def detect_anomalies(data):
    anomaly_prompt = f"""
    Analyze this time-series data for anomalies:
    {data}

    Look for:
    - Unusual spikes or drops
    - Pattern changes
    - Outliers
    - Seasonal variations

    Provide confidence scores for each anomaly detected.
    """

    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": anomaly_prompt}]
    )

    return response.content[0].text
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Preparation

- Clean and normalize your data before sending to Claude
- Provide context about your data schema and business domain
- Include relevant metadata (timestamps, units, etc.)

### 2. Prompt Engineering

- Be specific about what you want Claude to analyze
- Provide examples of the type of insights you're looking for
- Use structured prompts for consistent results

### 3. Cost Optimization

- Batch analysis requests when possible
- Use appropriate model sizes for your use case
- Cache results to avoid redundant API calls

### 4. Security

- Never send sensitive data to Claude without proper anonymization
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement proper access controls

## Error Handling

```python
import anthropic
from anthropic import APIError

def safe_claude_analysis(data):
    try:
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
            max_tokens=1000,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": data}]
        )
        return response.content[0].text
    except APIError as e:
        print(f"Anthropic API error: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        return None
```

## Monitoring and Logging

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def log_analysis_request(data_size, response_time, success):
    logger.info(f"""
    Claude Analysis Request:
    - Data size: {data_size} records
    - Response time: {response_time}ms
    - Success: {success}
    """)
```

## Integration with QuestDB Web Console

You can also integrate Claude analysis directly into the QuestDB Web Console by:

1. Creating custom JavaScript functions that call the Anthropic API
2. Adding analysis results as comments or annotations to your queries
3. Storing insights back to QuestDB for historical tracking

## Next Steps
